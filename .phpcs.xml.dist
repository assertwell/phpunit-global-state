        Each of the traits will likely have a private array property that contains the global data
        to be restored, but we don't want to risk this conflicting with other properties that users
        might define in their tests.

        As a result, we'll use the convention of `private $_somePropertyName`, but the underscore is
        *not* meant to indicate visibility, but rather to avoid conflict.
